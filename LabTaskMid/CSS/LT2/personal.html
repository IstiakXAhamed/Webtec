      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> Istiak</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Background:</strong> I am a CSE student currently in my third
        year. I enjoy building small projects, exploring web technologies, and
        improving my practical coding skills. I try to learn concepts by doing,
        not just reading. My goal is to develop strong foundations in software
        engineering and become confident in real-world development.

      <p style="color: blue">
        I also like studying AI because it feels futuristic and exciting.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p><strong>Program:</strong> BSc in Computer Science & Engineering</p>
      <p>
        I have completed core subjects like Structured Programming, OOP, Data
        Structures, Algorithms, and Web Technologies. Recently, I have been
        focusing on hands-on work, mini projects, and understanding how software
        is actually built in the industry. I believe education becomes more
        meaningful when theory connects with real applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my semesters, I also worked on team projects that helped me
        understand collaboration, planning, and time management.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy photography, especially capturing natural light and creative
        compositions. I also like experimenting with different camera settings
        and learning new techniques. Apart from that, I code small utilities,
        read about AI advancements, and play strategy or simulation games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I get free time, I explore new tools or try out new features in
        web development just to stay updated and improve myself.
